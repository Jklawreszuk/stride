# Stride Metrics ServerApp

## Prerequisites

- `ASPNET_ENVIRONMENT`: Set this variable to `Development` if you want to run the application in a testing environment. In the development environment, the application will connect to a non-Local SQL Server, allowing you to run the application on any operating system (i.e. [by using docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server).).
- `--SeedMetricsData` (recommended): Set this argument if you want to seed the database with initial data.

## Getting Started

To run the application, use Visual Studio or type in the console following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```
